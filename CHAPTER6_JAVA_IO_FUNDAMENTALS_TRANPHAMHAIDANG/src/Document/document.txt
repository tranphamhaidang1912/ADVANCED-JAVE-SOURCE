ΩA document is a written, drawn, presented or recorded representation of thoughts.
Originating from the Latin Documentum meaning lesson - the verb doce≈ç means to teach, and is pronounced similarly, in the past it was usually used as a term for a written proof used as evidence.
In the computer age, a document is usually used to describe a primarily textual file, along with its structure and design, such as fonts, colors and additional images.
